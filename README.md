# Retail-sales-forecasting
<p>This project is not my original idea. I have practiced the code given by Prajwal Saxena on his blog (https://towardsdatascience.com/5-data-science-projects-that-you-can-complete-over-the-weekend-34445b14707d).</p>

<p>In this project we use various regression model to train our dataset, to predict weekly_sales of particular store, and hence we can predict overall sales of that company.</p>

<p>Through this project I learned the basics to intermediate level knwoledge of how real world prediction model is built.</p>
